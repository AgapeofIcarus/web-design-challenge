 UNCC Data Bootcamp Project for HTML
![Creating a page to display visualizations.](https://github.com/AgapeofIcarus/web-design-challenge/blob/main/Visuals/equatorsign.png?raw=true)

In this project, we refer back to the WeatherPy API project and the results we found. For this task, my job was to create html and css files to display my findings. There requirements for this were:

* A landing page, data page, comparison page which contained all visuals, and individual pages for each visual with a summary.
* A navigation bar with the page title as a functioning link and a dropdown menu for the visuals.
* Responsive pages that grow and shrink to accomodate the screen in use.
* Be creative, but functional.
